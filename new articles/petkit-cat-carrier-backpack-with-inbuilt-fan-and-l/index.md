> Our cat was constantly getting her claws stuck in our other cat carrier, but we couldn't go for a full hard plastic case as it needs to go inside the car.
It has a hard shell, so she was protected and appeared at ease and comfortable inside during her travels.
Obviously there is no assembly required, so that part was easy.
It is a little heavier than the canvas bag we previously used, but you can use this as a backpack so makes it easier to carry.

> This product is brilliant! I needed a carrier for my Yorkshire Terrier for my moped & this is perfect. He didn’t make a fuss when I put him into it, he had plenty of room & it feels really secure! The product seems to be good quality & i’m happy to pay out more for safety reasons. I’m hoping it proves to be worth the money as time goes on.
